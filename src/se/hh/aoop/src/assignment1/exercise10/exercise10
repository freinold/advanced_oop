Polymorphism in this case allows you to compare objects that implements the Comparable type according to their own
specific behaviour, still using the same compareTo() method. It simplifies the implementation for the user, that
only needs to know one method, while the implementation of the method in each of the object's class specifies what needs
to be compared.
